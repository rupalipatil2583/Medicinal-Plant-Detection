#Medicinal-Plant-Detection-Classification
The "Medicinal Plant Detection and Classification" project is a Flask-based web application that identifies and classifies medicinal plants such as Aloe Vera, Lemon, Lemongrass, Maka, and Turmeric from uploaded images. It uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Keras deep learning model to predict the plant species and provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.
